# Propagation model 
Path loss propagation is applied in free space, and the free space path loss (FSPL) model is a theoretical tool in communications used to estimate the amount of attenuation (attenuation) of a radio signal as it travels between two antennas. It assumes an ideal environment with a clear line of sight, making it ideal for scenarios such as satellite communications.
The FSPL code was created by using the Matlab application, so that the 
## Pathloss 
is calculated. The best result for it is that it is less than 100,
## Received Signal Strength (RSS)
is calculated. The relationship between it and the PL is direct, so that if the PL weakens, the RSS also weakens, and vice versa, as if the PL increases. RSS increases and this means a weak signal

## Throughput 
is at its best when it is reduced and represented by this equation

## Signal to Interference & Noise Ratio (SINR)
is its best ratio when it is between
  5-19 dB
