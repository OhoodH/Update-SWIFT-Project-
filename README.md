# Propagation model 
Path loss propagation is applied in free space, and the free space path loss (FSPL) model is a theoretical tool in communications used to estimate the amount of attenuation (attenuation) of a radio signal as it travels between two antennas. It assumes an ideal environment with a clear line of sight, making it ideal for scenarios such as satellite communications.
The FSPL code was created by using the Matlab application, so that the 
## Pathloss 
is calculated. The best result for it is that it is less than 100,
## Received Signal Strength (RSS)
is calculated. The relationship between it and the PL is direct, so that if the PL weakens, the RSS also weakens, and vice versa, as if the PL increases. RSS increases and this means a weak signal

## Throughput 
is at its best when it is reduced and represented by this equation

## Signal to Interference & Noise Ratio (SINR)
is its best ratio when it is between
  5-19 dB

  # BlockChain 
  It is to protect data sent from CubeSats to the ground station, with a special focus on detecting oil spills in the oceans.
We use blockchain technology to store decentralized and tamper-resistant data.
we use also in blockchain :

  ## smart contracts:
 for automated enforcement of rules. A smart contract is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain that automates the actions required in an agreement or contract. Smart contracts allow transactions and trusted agreements to be executed between disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority or legal system. Once completed, transactions are traceable and irreversible.

## IPFS Interplanetary File System,
For decentralized file storage, which is a decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing and storage network, IPFS uses content processing, which is one of its main characteristics, which means that each file on IPFS is uniquely identified by its content. IPFS is also resistant to Especially data loss because files remain available on other nodes even if the node fails.

  ## SHA-256 (Secure Hash Code) 
  for data integrity. It is a hashing algorithm that converts data to a string with a length of 256 bits. Its features are fast, cannot be tampered with, and connect blocks together securely.
Used to create digital signatures
And password hashing
And verify data integrity
